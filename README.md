# Mathlib for Graphics Engines

This Library is largely based on:  
-  [Foundations of Game Engine Developement 1 - Eric Lengyel](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/#fged1)
- [Hands-On C++ Game Animation Programming - Gabor Szauer](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-c-game-animation-programming/9781800208087)

This library serves the sole Purpose of learning for the author and is planned to be used in the future for own Graphics programming Exercises as a quick to navigate alternative for the glm Library which is superior to this in any case.
